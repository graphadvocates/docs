# Bridging from Gnosis Chain

The Graph AdvocatesDAO disburses grant payment on Gnosis Chain, therefore if you plan on using your funds on any other chain, such as Ethereum, 
then you will first need to bridge your tokens. Do NOT send tokens directly to addresses on other chains without bridging them first!

[OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) is what  Graph AdvocatesDAO recommends as the most reliable bridge to use on Gnosis Chain: transaction fees are in xDAI.

If you need more information in how to bridge your funds from Gnosis Chain to any other chain, you can read the [Official OmniBridge documentation](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tutorials/using-omnibridge/).
Please note that the article is explaining how to transfer any ERC20 from Ethereum to xDai (Gnosis Chain), in your case you have to perform the same process but from xDai to Ethereum (or any other chain).
