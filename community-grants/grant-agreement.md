Grant Recipient Work Product includes without limitation any Deliverables that Grant Recipient delivers to AdvocatesDAO pursuant to Section 1.3.


### 
    4.3 Ownership of Grant Recipient Work Product

Grant Recipient and AdvocatesDAO agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each item of Grant Recipient Work Product will be owned by Grant Recipient; provided, however, that Grant Recipient shall, and hereby does, irrevocably and perpetually grant to the general public, including in particular The Graph Users, all rights and licenses in and to the Grant Recipient Work Product pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Apache License 2.0 open source license (such grant, the “**_Open Source License Grant”)_**.  Subject to the Open Source License Grant, AdvocatesDAO hereby irrevocably transfers and assigns to Grant Recipient all right, title and interest in and to the Grant Recipient Work Product, including all worldwide patent rights (including patent applications and disclosures), copyright rights, mask work rights, trade secret rights, know-how, and any and all other intellectual property or proprietary rights (collectively, “**_Intellectual Property Rights_**”) therein that AdvocatesDAO may have.

### 
    4.4 Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Grant Recipient irrevocably waives and agrees never to assert, any and all Moral Rights (as defined below) that Grant Recipient may have in or with respect to any Grant Recipient Work Product, during and after the term of this Agreement.  “**_Moral Rights_**” mean any rights to claim authorship of a work, to object to or prevent the modification or destruction of a work, to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of a work, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right as called or generally referred to as a “moral right.”

To the extent that Grant Recipient owns or controls (presently or in the future) any patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, trade secret rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights that are necessary for the exercise by the general public, including in particular The Graph Users, of the Open Source License Grant (collectively, “**_Related Rights_**”), Grant Recipient hereby grants to all licensees of the Grant Recipient Work Product a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable and sub-licensable right and license, under all intellectual property rights in and to the Related Rights, to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, make, have made, offer to sell, sell, and import all Related Rights to the extent required for the use of the Grant Recipient Work Product pursuant to the Open Source License Grant, and will cause such rights to be granted.  If Grant Recipient reasonably believes in good faith that the grant of Related Rights set forth in this Section will unduly compromise an Established Interest, Grant Recipient will promptly provide notice to AdvocatesDAO no later than five (5) business days of entering into the relevant Grant.  AdvocatesDAO will then discuss in good faith with Grant Recipient for a period of ten (10) business days means by which the Established Interest might be accounted for in a manner consistent with the purpose set forth in Section 4.1.  Grant Recipient will suspend Services under the relevant Grant pending such discussions.  If such discussions are fruitful, the parties will agree to amend this Agreement accordingly.
