# Presenting to the Grant Committee

The Grant Committee is meeting on the weekly basis and the meetings are split into two segments - the private and the public one. 

Public segment of the Grant Committee meeting
The public segment of the Grant Committee meeting is a gathering of all members of The Graph Community including Community Grant applicants, grantees, Graph Advocates, and Graph AdvocatesDAO members in the Grant Committee.

The public segment of the Grant Committee meeting is designed primarily for the Community Grant applicants to present their Community Grant proposal, inform, persuade, and clarify questions from the community. It is also a good opportunity for all community members to talk about the vision and roadmap for the community in general.

As the applicant:

* Prepare any materials connected with your grant proposal which could help visualize your idea
* Tell a story - how did you come up with the idea? How will your proposal impact other Community members?
* Prioritize - break your goals into actionable steps 
* Try to draft a road map, set milestones or a time plan for your project
* Don't be afraid to ask for help
* Reflect on feedback and don't hesitate to adjust your proposal, if you feel it's needed.
* Engage in the review process of other grant proposals to get the impression of what you can expect
* Keep the right pace of your presentation - it's better to be slow, then too fast
* Stay relaxed and in the open, growth mindset


Private segment of the Grant Committee meetings
The main purpose of the private segment of the Grant Committee meeting is to make decisions on implementation of structures, practices, systems and techniques that affect the Grant Committee as a governing body with the goal to modify and enhance the Committee organization and performance according to the needs of the Community and the DAO itself. 

This is done by sharing information and studying the influence of the processes the DAO currently have in place. The Committee members are also reaching agreements and aligning the process to the rapidly changing and complex environment through organizational strategies, which include identification of problems, inefficiencies and issues, action plans and progress evaluation.
