# After receiving a grant

The Graph AdvocatesDAO provides funding for grants in two tranches: 20% at the beginning and 80% upon completion of the grant. The Graph AdvocatesDAO may agree to deviations from the 20/80% standard rule on a case-by-case basis per established procedures as determined by the Grant Committee. Grants will be denominated in GRT by default, though the Graph AdvocatesDAO may agree to denominate any grant in a different currency or digital asset that the DAO has white listed. 

Therefore, a grantee must submit two funding proposals separate from one another for the specified percentage of the total grant. Grantees are required to follow all specified off-chain processes prior to submitting on-chain proposals in DAOHaus.
