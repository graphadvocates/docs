# Overview

Grant Showroom is a place designed to spotlight projects and initiatives, which gained recognition and support form The Graph's Community, successfully completed the DAO's internal review and due diligence processes, and as a result received a grant from The Graph AdvocatesDAO. 

Grantees are the centrepiece of our Community and an important source to keep The Graph ecosystem growing. In this section, Grantees will be able to showcase the product of their work they have passion for, and for which they received a Community Grant. Whether your Community Grant is completed, in-progress, or running on continuous basis, everyone is welcome to promote their contributions in the Grant Showroom section.
